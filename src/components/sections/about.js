            <p>
            Hi, My name is Mohit Varikuti. I am currently 13 years old. I have an IQ of 217. I was born in Los Gatos, and I currently live in Dublin, CA. 
            I am currently a AI expert, certified by the Global Tech Council. I am Currently building projects most people cant even dream of, including Super Intelligent AI's. 
            I also know 15 coding languages, which of include Python, Javascript, and HTML, (The same kind that coded this website). I also currently have a patent pending, for a Zigby IOT Mesh Network system. 
            I also currently have a 3d printer , which I know how to operate and repair. 
            </p>
  
            <p>
            Some of my skills include, 3d printing, IOT, Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Hardware, Biotech, Web Development, VR Development, Frontend and Backend coding, and Automated Drone Flying. 
            I also have verifications on all of these topics from MIT, to Harvard, to University of Michigan. 
            But really, these things don't tell much about a person. Most of the time, to understand the person, you have to meet them. 
            And I hope to meet all of you someday, but for now, I will tell you about myself. 
            My mindset has always been a certain way that I was able to understand the things that no one else was able to. 
            In my life, I have always loved to solve puzzles, and things that were mentally challenging to the brain. 
            </p>
  
            <p>  
            And while I used my brain alot, I also use my physical strength and determination as well. 
            I am currently First Class in Boy Scouts, and I am aiming to be an Eagle Scout, and as well, I also very much enjoy Biking, as it is one of my favorite things to do. 
            I hope that this has given an accurate insight into my life, and that all details were covered.
            </p>

            <p>Here are some of my Major Skills:</p>
